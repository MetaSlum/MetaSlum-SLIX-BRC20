# What is the MetaSlum?
The MetaSlums will be a highly immersive metaverse built on the Bitmap Standard, with a unique Old Western theme. This digitally rendered world is inspired by the acclaimed Red Dead Redemption series by Rockstar Games. However, MetaSlum aims to elevate this inspiration, designing a lifelike simulation of the Old Western era that will immerse gamers into a world where anything is possible. The MetaSlums will facilitate the creation of genuine in-game businesses and a thriving in-game economy, all while immersing participants in the exhilarating adventures synonymous with the Wild West.

At the heart of MetaSlum's sustainability strategy is the establishment of a central town with the first collection of businesses within the metaverse. This bustling town center will host a variety of establishments, including a saloon, concert hall, bank, outfitters, gunsmith, stables, and even a brothel. These businesses will generate revenue to ensure the long-term viability of the project.

The Saloon will be the social hub of MetaSlum, offering a venue for private gatherings, networking events akin to Twitter Spaces, and invigorating gambling opportunities. It will be a digital nexus where camaraderie and excitement coalesce. The Concert Hall will provide a platform for musicians, entertainers, public speakers and lecturers to showcase their talents and host live events. This interactive space promises to deliver captivating live concerts and performances, educational workshops and more for user enjoyment. The Bank will serve as a dynamic marketplace for buying, selling, trading, and staking Bitcoin, Satoshis, and SLIX, while the Outfitters, Gunsmith, and Stables will each host their respective in-game gear, weapon loadouts, and mounts marketplaces. These will offer players an extensive range of equipment and mounts to enhance their in-game experiences. The Brothel, an adult-only venue, will provide a platform for expression and beauty in various forms, catering to a discerning clientele in the Metaverse.

However, MetaSlum is more than just business; it's an intricately crafted universe. With meticulous attention to detail, it seeks to provide an immersive and enriching experience for casual players and serious gamers alike. They can explore its vast landscapes, engage in player-versus-player (PvP) events, undertake quests, and participate in treasure hunts with real SLIX tokens as prizes, among other engaging activities. MetaSlum promises to be a dynamic, immersive world, intertwining business, adventure, and community in a unique, digitally-rendered Wild West setting.

# The $SLIX BRC20 Token - An in-game currency for the MetaSlums
SLIX is a novel BRC20 token, minted directly within the Bitcoin ecosystem, tailored specifically to bring an immersive and interactive experience to the Bitmap MetaSlum metaverse. This metaverse marks the debut of the Old Western style in the digital realm, showcasing an innovative concept built upon Bitsohi Blockamoto's Bitmap standard. These standard permits individuals to take ownership of Bitcoin transaction blocks, transforming this data into a form of digital real estate, thus paving the way for the development of metaverse ecosystems upon Bitcoin.

SLIX is envisioned as the in-game currency for MetaSlum, intended to fuel an interactive economy within the metaverse. With SLIX, users and gamers alike will have a transactional medium at their fingertips, facilitating seamless trading of goods, services, and assets within the MetaSlum.

# $SLIX Use Cases
In addition to serving as a standard in-game currency, SLIX stands out as an in-game reserve currency allowing for the building of an in-game world economy. $SLIX will empower users to engage in a variety of in-game transactions, such as buying and selling gear, weapons, mounts, property, and services. The unique nature of MetaSlum allows users to purchase digital real estate, offering an exclusive opportunity to construct a diverse range of applications on their properties, be it a personalized home, an art gallery, a business enterprise, a casino, a restaurant, a grocery store and more.

Beyond transactions, SLIX will provide additional benefits and perks to its holders. These perks include eligibility for future Ordinal PFP airdrops, voting rights in the MetaSlum's in-game government, parcel sale discounts, gambling perks and more. Furthermore, SLIX holders will have the chance to stake their tokens within the in-game bank allowing users and gamers a secure place to park their SLIX and continue to build wealth. By mirroring the fundamental features of real-world currencies, SLIX fosters an integrated digital economic ecosystem.

# $SLIX Token Distribution
SLIX was first deployed on July 4th, 2023 and was introduced to the public through a fair launch on the Unisat.io platform on July 12, 2023. A total of 10,000,000 SLIX tokens were minted at its genesis, all of which were made accessible to the wider public without any preferential allocation. SLIX minted out within 2 days. 

In an unprecedented move, the SLIX project has chosen not to create any team, venture capitalist, marketing, or developer wallets. Instead, the entirety of the supply has been released to the public, embodying a fully democratic and fair approach to token distribution. This strategy underscores the SLIX team's commitment to maintaining a people-centric, equitable, and transparent digital currency.

The value of SLIX is thus not subject to manipulation by any team member or specific stakeholder. Instead, it is left to be determined by the collective activity of its community of holders and traders. By decentralizing the control over its value, SLIX fosters a user-driven economy within the MetaSlum metaverse, where the power of valuation rests entirely with the community.

# Security & Risk Management
SLIX, being a BRC20 token in the Bitcoin ecosystem, inherits the robust security features inherent to Bitcoin's blockchain technology. This translates into a highly secure environment for token transactions and storage, providing SLIX holders with an added layer of protection.

At the heart of SLIX's security is its decentralized nature. Unlike centralized systems, where a single point of failure can lead to systemic risks, SLIX's decentralized network is distributed among multiple nodes, making it extremely resilient to attacks.

SLIX employs cryptographic technology to secure transactions and control the creation of new tokens. Each SLIX transaction is encrypted and once confirmed, it becomes part of the immutable blockchain record. This process ensures the integrity and the chronological order of transactions, preventing double-spending and providing transparency for all operations.

SLIX also uses a proof-of-work system, which requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add a block to the blockchain. This system makes it computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power.

In addition, user wallets are protected through private keys, long strings of numbers and letters linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm used to create them. The private key is used to sign transactions, providing a mathematical proof that they have come from the owner of the wallet.

Through these mechanisms, SLIX provides a secure environment for token holders, minimizing the risk of fraud and hacking, and ensuring the integrity and reliability of transactions within the MetaSlum metaverse.

# Socials
The team is currently developing the foundation for what will be the online community for SLIX and MetaSlums. We will be kicking off the project with a twitter and discord where we hope to begin our community growth phase. During this phase we will work with the community to establish a strong brand for the project including logos, graphics, websites and more.

Our socials will be the foundation for community growth. The community growth will be critical to the success of this project since there will be no VC’s, whales, influencers etc involved in the early phases of the project. Our first round of seed fund raising will come with the parcel sale, so until that moment Community growth will be the predominant emphasis of the SLIX/MetaSlums team.

# Presence in Bitmap Valley
MetaSlums has achieved a noteworthy position within the trailblazing bitmap metaverse, Bitmap Valley, masterminded by the visionary IMSOnft_Chris. The team envisions this strategic positioning as a potent gateway, leading directly into the vibrant ecosystem of MetaSlum. Being one of the initial projects to emerge in the bitmap landscape, both MetaSlums and the associated SLIX token are positioned advantageously to engage the extensive user base of Bitmap Valley. This symbiotic relationship with Bitmap Valley is anticipated to serve as a vital catalyst, amplifying the visibility of MetaSlums to a much broader demographic.

# MetaSlum Parcel Sale
In a bid to garner support for development and marketing efforts, a Bitmap parcel sale will be conducted. This sale will offer early purchasers, referred to as Homesteaders, exclusive access to the MetaSlum world. These Homesteaders will have the liberty to construct upon their land parcels, shaping the landscape of MetaSlum. Furthermore, SLIX holders stand to gain additional benefits such as whitelist opportunities, discounts, and more, infusing greater utility and appeal to the SLIX token.

The Parcel sale aims to raise seed funding for the project. This seed funding will then be used to attract strong VC partnerships to raise round 1, 2 and 3 funding for the full development of the project. Since SLIX is a community token and no wallets have been set aside for VC’s, the project aims to offer VCs instead a percentage of revenue generated by MetaSlums core businesses. We will invite the community to pitch in and discuss this aspect of the project before launching the parcel presale. These discussions will exclusively take place within the project discord.

# Team Building, Funding Rounds and SLIX Buy Backs
Upon the successful completion of the parcel sale, the team will shift its attention to team expansion. The team will be in discussions with bitcoin developers, graphic designers, conceptual artists, game developers, legal experts, financial experts, community managers, software developers, and more during the community growth phase. We will finalize these partnerships upon the completion of the parcel sale.

Initial seed funding from the parcel sale will go towards onboarding the development team and beginning work on what will become the MetaSlums metaverse. While the team begins building, the founder will focus his attention on Round 1, 2 and 3 funding, business development & partnerships and SLIX promotional initiatives including buy backs to be used for give aways and CEX liquidity.

# Ordinals in the MetaSlums
The MetaSlums project also anticipates launching an Ordinal PFP initiative. This project is devised not only as a fundraising effort for further development and marketing but also as a means to enhance the vibrant, multi-faceted world of MetaSlums. These Ordinal PFPs will assume diverse roles within the MetaSlum ecosystem, from serving as unique identifiers and avatars for in-game characters to becoming valued assets in their own right.

Ordinal PFPs are set to become a significant part of the MetaSlum ecosystem, with most in-game items being inscribed as ordinals. This approach empowers users to possess real digital assets, the value of which will be determined by market forces. Ordinals will take the form of a plethora of in-game assets, including character skins, weapons, accessories, mounts, real estate deeds, businesses, and more. Notably, the MetaSlums project encourages the community's involvement, welcoming suggestions for potential Ordinals to be integrated into the ecosystem. This community-driven strategy promotes a sense of ownership and collective growth among the participants, further enriching the MetaSlum world and enhancing the value proposition of the SLIX token.
